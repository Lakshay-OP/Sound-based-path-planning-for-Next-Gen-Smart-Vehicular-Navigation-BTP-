# Sound-based-path-planning-for-Next-Gen-Smart-Vehicular-Navigation-BTP-
The Sound-Based Path Planning project for next-generation smart vehicular navigation leverages sound signals, such as beeps, to control vehicle movement and path selection. The intensity and number of beeps provide real-time information to adjust the vehicle's speed and direction. For instance, specific beep patterns may guide the vehicle forward, backward, or make turns. This method is especially useful in environments where GPS or visual navigation may be unreliable, such as indoors or in dense urban areas. By integrating sound-based navigation with sensors for obstacle detection, the system can dynamically adjust the vehicle's path to avoid collisions and optimize movement. This technology is a step towards more flexible and intelligent autonomous driving solutions, opening possibilities for smart transportation in future urban infrastructure.
